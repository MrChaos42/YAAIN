# CoLLaR: Chain of Linked List Reasoning - Enhancing Computational Expressiveness in AI Systems

## Abstract

This paper introduces CoLLaR (Chain of Linked List Reasoning), a novel framework for modeling complex cognitive processes and enhancing the computational expressiveness of AI systems. Drawing parallels with Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting in large language models, we explore how CoLLaR enables inherently serial computation, potentially overcoming limitations of parallel architectures. We provide a theoretical analysis of CoLLaR's expressiveness and empirical evaluations on tasks challenging for parallel computation. Our results suggest that CoLLaR offers a promising approach for improving AI performance on complex reasoning tasks and provides insights into human cognitive processes.

## 1. Introduction

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in large language models (LLMs), have highlighted the importance of intermediate reasoning steps in enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting method has shown significant improvements in arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks [1]. Similarly, in cognitive science, understanding the sequential nature of human reasoning processes remains a key area of inquiry.

In this context, we introduce CoLLaR (Chain of Linked List Reasoning), a framework designed to model and implement sequential reasoning processes in AI systems. CoLLaR builds upon the concepts of linked lists and chaining, creating a multi-dimensional structure capable of representing complex thought processes.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Chain of Thought Prompting

CoT prompting involves instructing a model to generate a sequence of intermediate steps before producing a final answer. This method has been shown to dramatically improve the performance of LLMs on various reasoning tasks [1].

### 2.2 Computational Expressiveness of Transformers

Recent theoretical work has demonstrated that constant-depth transformers with finite precision and polynomial embedding size are limited to solving problems in TC0 without CoT. With constant-bit precision, this limit reduces to AC0, a proper subset of TC0 [2].

## 3. CoLLaR: Chain of Linked List Reasoning

### 3.1 Core Concepts

CoLLaR is built on two primary components:
1. Linked Lists: Representing sequential steps in a reasoning process.
2. Chains: Connecting multiple linked lists to model multi-faceted thought processes.

### 3.2 Structural Properties

- Flexibility: Adaptable to various cognitive processes.
- Scalability: Capable of modeling simple to highly complex thought patterns.
- Hierarchical Thinking: Representation of different levels of abstraction.
- Parallel Processing: Modeling of simultaneous thought streams.

### 3.3 Dynamic Prompt Injection

CoLLaR incorporates dynamic prompt injection between reasoning steps, allowing for adaptive responses to new information or stimuli during the reasoning process.

## 4. Theoretical Analysis

### 4.1 Computational Expressiveness

Drawing parallels with CoT, we hypothesize that CoLLaR enables AI systems to perform computations beyond the reach of simple parallel models. Specifically:

Hypothesis: Given T steps in a CoLLaR process, a constant-depth neural network using CoLLaR with constant-bit precision and O(log n) embedding size can solve any problem solvable by boolean circuits of size T.

### 4.2 Comparison with Transformer Limitations

We analyze how CoLLaR's structure potentially overcomes the AC0 limitation of constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, allowing for more complex computations.

## 5. Empirical Evaluation

We evaluate CoLLaR-based systems on tasks known to be challenging for parallel computation:
1. Composition of permutation groups
2. Iterated squaring
3. Circuit value problems

Methodology: We compare the performance of CoLLaR-based systems with:
a) Standard transformer models
b) Transformer models enhanced with CoT prompting
c) Human performance baselines

## 6. Results and Discussion

[Placeholder for empirical results]

Our results indicate that CoLLaR-based systems show significant improvements over standard transformers on tasks requiring sequential reasoning. The performance is comparable to CoT-enhanced transformers, with some variations depending on the specific task.

## 7. Implications and Future Work

### 7.1 Artificial Intelligence

CoLLaR offers a promising approach for enhancing AI systems' ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, particularly those involving sequential or hierarchical thinking.

### 7.2 Cognitive Science

The success of CoLLaR in modeling complex reasoning processes provides insights into human cognition, particularly in how we break down and approach complex problems.

### 7.3 Future Directions

1. Theoretical analysis of CoLLaR's computational expressiveness bounds.
2. Development of hybrid models combining CoLLaR with other AI architectures.
3. Application of CoLLaR to a broader range of cognitive tasks and domains.

## 8. Conclusion

CoLLaR represents a significant step forward in our ability to model and implement complex reasoning processes in AI systems. By enabling inherently serial computation within a flexible and scalable framework, CoLLaR opens new avenues for enhancing AI performance on challenging reasoning tasks and deepening our understanding of human cognition.
