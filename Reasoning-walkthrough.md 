# YAAIN System Resolving a Complex Reasoning Question

## 1. The Question

Let's consider the following complex reasoning question:

"In a small town, there are three types of people: truth-tellers who always tell the truth, liars who always lie, and neutrals who sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie. You meet three people, A, B, and C. A says, 'B is a liar.' B says, 'C is a neutral.' C says, 'A is not a truth-teller.' What type is each person?"

## 2. YAAIN System Approach

### 2.1 Initial Processing (Dual Agent System - System 1)

The fast, intuitive System 1 of the Dual Agent component quickly processes the question:

1. Identifies key elements: three person types, three individuals, three statements
2. Recognizes the logical nature of the problem
3. Flags the need for deeper analysis due to the problem's complexity

### 2.2 Problem Representation (Artifact Generation)

The Artifact Generation component creates a structured representation of the problem:

```
Artifact: Logic Problem Structure

Persons: A, B, C
Types: Truth-teller, Liar, Neutral

Statements:
1. A says: "B is a liar"
2. B says: "C is a neutral"
3. C says: "A is not a truth-teller"

Goal: Determine the type of each person
```

### 2.3 Solution Strategy (Chain of Thought Reasoning)

The Chain of Thought (CoT) component outlines a strategy for solving the problem:

1. List all possible type combinations for A, B, and C
2. For each combination, evaluate the consistency of the statements
3. Eliminate inconsistent combinations
4. Identify the combination that satisfies all conditions

### 2.4 Detailed Analysis (Dual Agent System - System 2)

The slower, analytical System 2 takes over for the detailed reasoning process:

#### Step 1: List all possible combinations

The system generates an artifact listing all possible type combinations:

```
Artifact: Type Combinations

1.  (T, T, T)    2.  (T, T, L)    3.  (T, T, N)
4.  (T, L, T)    5.  (T, L, L)    6.  (T, L, N)
7.  (T, N, T)    8.  (T, N, L)    9.  (T, N, N)
10. (L, T, T)    11. (L, T, L)    12. (L, T, N)
13. (L, L, T)    14. (L, L, L)    15. (L, L, N)
16. (L, N, T)    17. (L, N, L)    18. (L, N, N)
19. (N, T, T)    20. (N, T, L)    21. (N, T, N)
22. (N, L, T)    23. (N, L, L)    24. (N, L, N)
25. (N, N, T)    26. (N, N, L)    27. (N, N, N)

T: Truth-teller, L: Liar, N: Neutral
```

#### Step 2: Evaluate each combination

The system methodically evaluates each combination, creating a new artifact to track the analysis:

```
Artifact: Combination Analysis

(L, L, T) - Consistent:
- A (Liar) says "B is a liar" - True statement, but A always lies, so consistent
- B (Liar) says "C is a neutral" - False statement, consistent for a liar
- C (Truth-teller) says "A is not a truth-teller" - True statement, consistent

All other combinations lead to contradictions.
```

#### Step 3: Conclusion

The system identifies the only consistent combination: (L, L, T)

### 2.5 Solution Verification (Chain of Thought Reasoning)

The CoT component verifies the solution by checking each statement:

1. A (Liar) says "B is a liar" - This is true, but A is lying, so it's consistent
2. B (Liar) says "C is a neutral" - This is false, which is consistent for a liar
3. C (Truth-teller) says "A is not a truth-teller" - This is true, consistent for a truth-teller

### 2.6 Response Generation (Stochastic Response Selection)

The Stochastic Response Selection component generates multiple possible response phrasings:

1. "A is a liar, B is a liar, and C is a truth-teller."
2. "The analysis reveals that A and B are both liars, while C always tells the truth."
3. "Based on the given statements, we can conclude that A and B are liars, and C is a truth-teller."

The system selects option 3 as the final response, balancing clarity and detail.

## 3. Final Output

The YAAIN system produces the following final output:

"Based on the given statements, we can conclude that A and B are liars, and C is a truth-teller. This is the only combination that maintains consistency with all three statements made by A, B, and C."

## 4. Reflection and Learning

After solving the problem, the YAAIN system reflects on the process:

1. Identifies the effectiveness of systematic combination analysis for logic puzzles
2. Notes the importance of considering all possibilities before drawing conclusions
3. Recognizes the value of creating structured artifacts (like the combination list) for complex problems
4. Flags this problem type for future reference in similar scenarios

The system updates its knowledge base with these insights, potentially improving its performance on similar problems in the future.
