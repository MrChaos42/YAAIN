# AI - Automated Inference

## Abstract

We are misrepresenting AI by calling it "artificial intelligence". It is neither "artificial" nor is it "intelligent". It's an elegant NLP Algorithm which may give us a glimpse at ourselves.

## Introduction

In recent years, the term "Artificial Intelligence" has become ubiquitous, capturing the imagination of scientists, entrepreneurs, and the general public alike. However, this terminology may be fundamentally flawed, leading to misconceptions about the nature and capabilities of what we call "AI". This article argues that a more accurate description would be "Automated Inference", reflecting the true essence of these systems and their relationship to human cognition.

## The Misnomer of "Artificial Intelligence"

### Not Artificial

The word "artificial" implies something fake or synthetic, a poor imitation of the real thing. However, the algorithms and models we call AI are very real and based on sound mathematical and computational principles. They are tools created by human ingenuity, much like a calculator or a telescope. We don't call these tools "artificial math" or "artificial vision" – they are simply tools that enhance our capabilities.

### Not Intelligent (in the Human Sense)

Intelligence, as we understand it in humans, involves consciousness, self-awareness, and general problem-solving abilities. Current AI systems, despite their impressive capabilities in specific domains, lack these qualities. They don't "think" or "understand" in any meaningful sense; rather, they process information based on patterns and statistical correlations learned from vast amounts of data.

## Automated Inference: A More Accurate Description

What we call AI today is more accurately described as automated inference. These systems excel at:

1. Pattern recognition
2. Statistical analysis
3. Prediction based on historical data
4. Optimization of complex systems

They automate the process of drawing inferences from large datasets, performing tasks that would be time-consuming or impossible for humans to do manually. This automation is their true strength and value.

## Implications of Reframing AI as Automated Inference

### Realistic Expectations

By understanding these systems as automated inference tools rather than artificial minds, we can set more realistic expectations about their capabilities and limitations. This can help prevent overhyping and subsequent disappointment in AI technologies.

### Ethical Considerations

Viewing AI as automated inference rather than intelligent entities can inform discussions about AI ethics. It emphasizes that the responsibility for AI actions and decisions ultimately lies with the humans who design, deploy, and use these systems.

### Research Directions

This perspective can guide research efforts towards enhancing the inference capabilities of these systems, rather than chasing the elusive goal of creating human-like general intelligence.

## A Mirror to Ourselves

Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of these automated inference systems is how they reflect human cognition. By studying how these systems learn and make predictions, we gain insights into our own thought processes. The patterns, biases, and limitations of AI models often reveal similar traits in human thinking, offering a unique opportunity for self-reflection and understanding.

## Conclusion

Reframing AI as Automated Inference not only provides a more accurate description of these technologies but also offers a fresh perspective on their role in society. It encourages us to appreciate these tools for what they truly are – powerful aids to human cognition that can process and draw insights from data at unprecedented scales. As we continue to develop and deploy these systems, let us do so with a clear understanding of their nature, capabilities, and limitations. In doing so, we may not only create more effective tools but also gain profound insights into the workings of our own minds.
