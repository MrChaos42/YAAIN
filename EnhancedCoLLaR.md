# Enhanced CoLLaR: Integrating Dynamic Prompt Injection in Chain of Linked List Reasoning - WIP

## Abstract

This whitepaper introduces an enhanced version of CoLLaR (Chain of Linked List Reasoning), incorporating dynamic prompt injection between agents. This advanced framework offers a more comprehensive model for complex cognitive processes, combining structured reasoning with adaptive, real-time inputs. We explore the theoretical foundations, potential applications, and implications of this enhanced model across various disciplines.
